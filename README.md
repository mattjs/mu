Mu Http Server
==============

This is a Http server written in Java. Still a lot of progress to be made...

This project requires [Bazel] (http://bazel.io/) to be built. After installing bazel
the library can be built by running the following command

```
  bazel build :mu
```

Which will output a binary to `bazel-bin/src/libmy.jar`.

Check out a test app [here] (https://github.com/mattjs/mu-test-app)
